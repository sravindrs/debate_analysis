Speaker 1 [0.01s - 26.53s]:  You're saying that you think it's the two narratives. Yeah, but we can't hear you very loudly. Maybe it's much better, much better.
Speaker 3 [4.60s - 25.21s]:  Yeah, I was just saying that I think it's pretty obvious why Native Americans would side with Palestinians. I didn't really know that there were Palestinians, that there were Native Americans who were pro-Israel. Sorry, is this better?
Speaker 3 [26.65s - 39.19s]:  Yeah, I was just saying that I'm not surprised that that they're Native Americans who are pro-Palestinian, but I didn't know about pro-Israel.
Speaker 1 [37.82s - 63.28s]:  So are you surprised by that? Because the point is that there are Native Americans that then seem to support Israel because of the claim for indigeneity. They understand what it's like to be a people, sometimes tribes that have the spiritual dimension to these tribes, they're kicked out of their land and now they want to come back to their land. That's also exactly the story of the Jews, no?
Speaker 2 [66.41s - 85.14s]:  I feel like the thing with the Jews is how like a lot of them were able to like I can see also some similarities there but I feel like the difference is that
Speaker 2 [85.69s - 106.12s]:  For a lot of Jews, a lot of them moved to other places like set up their homes over there, compared to the Native Americans in the Palestinians who like remained where they were. And only after everything that's been going on, that's when they thought it would be best to relocate. But for like the years before.
Speaker 1 [104.04s - 110.81s]:  Wait, you think the Jews left voluntarily? You think the Jews left Judea voluntarily?
Speaker 2 [116.56s - 133.10s]:  I don't think they necessarily left voluntarily because I'm thinking of this like before 1948 like what caused them to be in like Europe because
Speaker 2 [133.85s - 161.48s]:  I feel like for most people, they just think is like the people living in Israel now, like their ancestry comes from that area. But before 1948, they were able to like relook and live in other places. So whereas compared to Palestinians, they have been living there for many years and never having to face this kind of threat until 48.
Speaker 2 [162.96s - 180.45s]:  So I feel like that's where I draw the connection between. Yeah, so. OK, so like.
Speaker 1 [165.78s - 175.98s]:  Wait, wait, wait. I have some thoughts about this, but Beata, maybe you jump in.
Speaker 3 [172.33s - 179.44s]:  I don't know if I fully understood. Can you explain the timeline that you're talking about a little more clearly?
Speaker 2 [181.68s - 210.23s]:  I'm thinking before 48, like between, I don't know when exactly like Jews started leaving Judea and started like finding other places to live. But I'm thinking between that time and 48, the Jews were able to like, yes, they had to leave because of like outside reasons, not because necessarily they left voluntarily, but they were able to kind of build other
Speaker 2 [210.49s - 238.87s]:  or not built, but acclimated to other civilizations for a while, even though it had its hardships that they were discriminated against. Whereas compared to the Palestinians, they've been living there for many, many years, even before 48. So it's starting from 48 that they had to leave as well and go build some other
Speaker 2 [239.00s - 265.56s]:  I think another thing too that I just thought of is that it might also be because the Jews never had to deal with colonialism. I feel like that's the main point that resonates with Native Americans because they've also been under colonialist rule and now they see what's happening to the Palestinians as colonialist rule. It kind of reminds them of that as well.
Speaker 3 [270.71s - 285.11s]:  Um, okay. So the first point is that, okay. Well, the first, the first point I have, I take, I think it's interest, uh, like flawed reasoning because
Speaker 3 [285.90s - 305.78s]:  Like that's like, for example, I had a Palestinian friend who relocated to Bahrain after the Nakba and now she, that's her home. Right. And so like what you're saying about the Jews who live there. Or who like our origins are from Israel, which is like.
Speaker 3 [307.96s - 337.43s]:  over 2000 years, right? When did when did when's like the first archaeological findings of Jewish civilization there? Okay. And then like just like, then the so yeah, so just because like Jews were, they were persecuted, by the way, by every like nearly, it was either Jews were tolerated on the land or they were kicked off of the land by whatever
Speaker 1 [315.88s - 322.07s]:  First archaeological would probably be 4,000 years ago. Wow.
Speaker 3 [338.49s - 367.02s]:  um ruling force was that was in israel for up until the british colonized palestine and um secondly about the indigenous or wait what was the second one the second part was about oh the fact that the jews never had to deal with colonialism i don't think that is
Speaker 2 [359.44s - 360.71s]:  is about like the colonialism.
Speaker 3 [369.60s - 391.58s]:  accurate statement either because like wherever the Jews were living I mean I guess like you like you could say like they didn't have to deal with European colonialism even though like half of the Jewish population was like Middle Eastern colon lived in were Middle Eastern Jews and so whenever
Speaker 1 [383.87s - 384.26s]:  Yeah.
Speaker 3 [392.91s - 405.03s]:  Whenever the countries in the Middle East, well, there weren't any countries, but the territories that were conquered and colonized in the Middle East, the Jews that were living there also had to deal with that, right? What do you think, Adam?
Speaker 1 [405.26s - 421.00s]:  That's an interesting point. I do think that the some of the leaders even in the in the FLN and the Algerian resistance were Jews because they were Algerian Jews who resisted the French.
Speaker 3 [420.61s - 450.06s]:  And then I also think it's interesting to only focus on European colonialism because that like narrows down our perspective, right? Because that's like the Middle Eastern perspective that they were fucked over by the European colonialists. But the reality of history is that people were always colonizing one another. Like somebody was always taking over the land of somebody else and, and ruling over some other groups of people and suppressing them and oppressing them. And then.
Speaker 3 [450.40s - 468.25s]:  The power would just shift from hand to hand whoever was the ruling power and the people it's different the different peoples on whatever land was being dominated would vary based off of what the what the ruling power thought they should do with the various types of people that lived on the land.
Speaker 1 [474.05s - 477.52s]:  Yousuf, do you give a free pass to Ottoman colonialism?
Speaker 2 [481.94s - 499.26s]:  I don't necessarily give a pass to any form of colonialism because there's no reason why you should come into someone else's land and try to force your beliefs onto those people.
Speaker 3 [506.29s - 532.41s]:  Wait, what was your question, Adam, again? Oh, Ottoman colonialism? Yeah. Because, yeah, that was the most...
Speaker 1 [508.30s - 526.27s]:  If he was for Yusuf just now, that tiny jab, whether or not he was given a free pass to Ottoman colonialism.
Speaker 2 [511.66s - 538.46s]:  Mm hmm. All right. I thought that's yeah, I thought that's interesting. Yeah, most recent, like. Mm hmm.
Speaker 3 [533.56s - 553.30s]:  colonialism before the British colonialism. Also, do you think that Palestine existed before the British colonized as a country and as a nationhood, like as a national identity?
Speaker 2 [541.85s - 568.30s]:  Yeah, I feel like... Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I can... From what I've read on some of this, yeah, they...
Speaker 2 [569.02s - 589.31s]:  They had their own kind of identity before the British came in because they were like a common people. I think that's also the thing with the Ottoman colonialism because from the way I see it, it feels like
Speaker 2 [589.70s - 615.09s]:  the like what became the Ottoman Empire was kind of just like one group of just like Arabs and Middle Easterns and so like with the Ottoman Empire it kind of gave me maybe say like a little bit more structure to how the Middle East like looks and like paved the way for what it looks like today because it's still like
Speaker 2 [615.95s - 635.04s]:  to a certain extent it's still like the same people. I think the thing for me is like with Ottoman colonialism there's still like Middle Easterns and Arabs within each other compared to like European colonialism going into like the Americas.
Speaker 3 [635.08s - 636.73s]:  Wait but Turks aren't Arabs.
Speaker 2 [638.40s - 658.68s]:  No, yeah, like, in some, no, they're not Arabs, but in some respects, like, like I said, in the Middle Eastern, especially with like, like after the Ottoman Empire, in some respects, they're like part of that culture.
Speaker 1 [663.10s - 684.22s]:  Hmm. Ah. Sounds a little bit like a free pass, man. I got. They they're they're.
Speaker 3 [670.38s - 681.22s]:  I just looked it up on Reddit. They say it says our Turkish people, Turkish people consider themselves Middle Eastern and the first answer is no, never.
Speaker 1 [684.99s - 713.23s]:  they can first, not only did they not consider themselves Middle Eastern, they looked down on Arabs and they have for centuries. And that's one of the reasons why the Arabs wanted always to kind of shake their rule out of them, right? They wanted to be able to push back on the Ottomans, but probably not very strongly because they were still Muslims. So I feel like that's, they had some sense of camaraderie or whatever, at least we're being ruled over
Speaker 3 [711.78s - 731.37s]:  Wait, were the Turks considered like a subsection of the Ottomans? They didn't consider it. Huh. I always considered it like Ottoman Turks. Yeah.
Speaker 1 [717.86s - 742.69s]:  It depends, certainly towards the end, 100%, but even throughout. Oh yeah, no, but were Turks separate from Ottomans, you mean? Yes, but that's because you can have Arab, you can have like, it's just Arab subjects of the Ottoman Empire and Turkish subjects of the Ottoman Empire. It's just that the Turkish subjects are rich.
Speaker 3 [741.19s - 742.94s]:  Oh.
Speaker 1 [747.04s - 770.40s]:  But I don't think that, for example, Yusef, let me ask you this. How important is the claim to you that the Palestinian national consciousness emerged even before Ottoman rule, as opposed to, let's say, in the 20s? Like, what if we showed you, actually, they didn't consider themselves a palace, like the Palestinians didn't consider themselves a unique national identity until, let's say, the 30s. Would that change anything in your mind?
Speaker 2 [775.78s - 796.58s]:  I don't know, because it's still like, before the Jews started coming in, they still knew who they were. They had their identity, they knew that they were native, not like native, but like indigenous, and they were living in that land before the Jews started coming back.
Speaker 1 [794.39s - 811.36s]:  What if it's after the Jewish immigration that got them all of a sudden to start thinking, oh my God, maybe we are a national identity. Maybe there is some solidarity we all share. Could that be? And would that change anything in your mind?
Speaker 2 [814.80s - 836.99s]:  I feel like if they had no sense of nationhood and sovereignty and being... I don't know how hard to explain, but if they didn't have necessarily an identity and it was
Speaker 2 [838.18s - 866.49s]:  There were Arabs amongst themselves seeing Jews within that land. And then that kind of subsection that was made by the British to be what is now Palestine slash Israel. It would change it a little bit because to them back then they didn't really have any commonality between them.
Speaker 2 [867.93s - 890.85s]:  And it was just like seeing some new group that was, that did not look like them or like share their culture coming in. Yeah. So I still like summarize both. If they had a culture book, if they were like a nation before
Speaker 1 [878.51s - 880.78s]:  Can you explain that last sentence again?
Speaker 2 [891.97s - 921.19s]:  48 and they considered themselves Palestinian many out they would be indigenous to that when like the claim still stands with like why they would want to be living there. But if they had no real connection to each other until they saw this like foreign group come in to what was declared as their land, then yeah, it might change it a little bit because it's like
Speaker 2 [922.96s - 950.47s]:  you didn't really, you technically didn't have, it wasn't really your land to begin with until like a little bit ago. And like when it was made, you didn't really have a sense of national identity. So it might be a little bit more persuasive that way. Like I would, I would still feel like
Speaker 2 [952.21s - 964.92s]:  they have a reason to want the land for themselves, but I would be more understanding if they had a national identity before the juice came in than starting that national identity after.
Speaker 1 [965.55s - 994.31s]:  Beata, what's your take on either option? I mean, it's like I have a video. Oh yeah. And it feels like, did they have a concept of national identity before the Jews begin to immigrate or did they not? And I think that that makes a slight difference in use of smine. Not a whole, but yeah. Do you think that there's one, do you think it was one or the other?
Speaker 3 [972.45s - 1000.54s]:  Let me repeat the two options. I started reading something. I think it's pretty clear to me envisioning what it was like back then.
Speaker 3 [1001.80s - 1021.87s]:  When it was the Ottoman Empire and then the British colonized took over after the Ottomans who were also colonizers that like there was this sense of collective Arab identity, but I don't think that there was this because the Ottomans just ruled it enormous a vast territory didn't they rule all of Arabia.
Speaker 1 [1023.75s - 1024.02s]:  Yeah.
Speaker 3 [1024.00s - 1050.62s]:  So yeah, because of that, and then the British just ruled all of Arabia, and then the British created all of these countries and chopped up the Middle East. I think that up until that point, and up until there was... I don't really know what the demographics of Palestine was.
Speaker 3 [1050.78s - 1077.45s]:  though, during the Ottomans Empire before the Jews started immigrating in large waves. Was it mainly Arabs? So yeah, I think that there was like a collective Arab identity and I think that identity still exists, but now there's also the national identities that each Arab has, depending on what country they live in.
Speaker 1 [1061.36s - 1088.27s]:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. You said imagining that that is true. How would that change your thinking?
Speaker 3 [1078.51s - 1080.91s]:  which only were created by the British.
Speaker 2 [1089.92s - 1090.76s]:  Let's just say it again.
Speaker 1 [1091.39s - 1119.38s]:  Imagining that it's true that national self-consciousness by the Palestinians only emerged in reaction to, let's say, the British intrusion into Jewish immigration, into waves of Arab immigration into mandatory Palestine. Imagining that in the 20s or 30s, all of a sudden, there's a nation that is waking up to its own identity. In what way does that change your mind?
Speaker 1 [1120.45s - 1122.02s]:  Does it affect your thinking at all?
Speaker 2 [1129.29s - 1157.21s]:  I feel like it would still be like what I said before, like if they only had a national identity after the juice started moving in, I would still feel like I can understand their claim for wanting the land for themselves, but I can also see like why either side would want it. That makes sense.
Speaker 1 [1154.96s - 1176.90s]:  Right. So I'll tell you my thought on this. Do you want to hear how I think about this? I believe that it's pretty clear to me that national consciousness for Palestinians emerged in the 20s.
Speaker 2 [1164.12s - 1165.18s]:  Yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 1 [1177.79s - 1207.60s]:  late 19 times. They didn't even call themselves Palestinians. The people that call themselves Palestinians were the Jews who were living on the land. And oh, we lost Viata I think. Oh man, but I want to be out of to hear this because this is the point that you might not like. So I'll say it again though. You're here, right? You can hear me. I think that it's pretty clear to me the Palestinian consciousness emerged in reaction to Jewish immigration.
Speaker 2 [1198.92s - 1201.29s]:  Yeah, I can hear you.
Speaker 1 [1208.95s - 1234.57s]:  That, I think, is true. But so what? So what? Every identity, I think, is likely to emerge in reaction to some event that is happening. Jews probably emerged in some other Babylonian captivity for all I know. The Babylonians came, took over, and all of a sudden, all the Jews unite. Ah, now we have a common enemy there. So what? I think all of South America probably reacted to Napoleon.
Speaker 1 [1235.03s - 1259.92s]:  That's where they developed their national identity. American identity is in reaction to the British somewhat. Like it's not, it means nothing to me. Yeah, like nations come and go and identities continue to battle each other out and to continue to be in flux. And it doesn't mean that you yourself and your family don't have deep claims to the land.
Speaker 1 [1260.59s - 1274.82s]:  It just means that you didn't have the kind of national planes. And I think that Israelis like to point to the fact that there was never a Palestinian people in the sense of peoplehood. They didn't have it. But so what if they didn't have it?
Speaker 1 [1275.95s - 1291.65s]:  And now they have it. I mean, I think the only reason that now we think it matters is because of Woodrow Wilson's 14 points. If you win the war, if you win the First World War on the basis of saying every people deserve a country,
Speaker 1 [1291.99s - 1310.47s]:  Well, now it's a matter of debate. Who's a people and who's not a people? And now you have to start playing that. But I feel like that's a faulty framework in the first place. And it's making us quibble over what I think is trivial. But it doesn't matter. That's my take. What do you think about that?
Speaker 2 [1316.92s - 1341.80s]:  Yeah, I like that you brought up the similarity between that and the American colonies, because that's also what I was thinking when Mediata brought up that point, is that if Palestinian national identity emerged as a result of wanting to get out of British rule, then
Speaker 2 [1343.92s - 1371.61s]:  I don't like, similar to what I said before, like, I don't necessarily blame them for wanting to explain, like distance themselves or from that Imperial system, but it. Hmm. But yeah, like.
Speaker 1 [1358.95s - 1388.87s]:  No, I feel that they emerged in the action to Jewish immigration. But yeah. Yeah, you got up exactly where I wanted to upset you. So you can hear me OK now? So Yusuf, is that OK if I repeat that? OK, so I was saying that I think it's pretty clear to me that
Speaker 3 [1366.39s - 1379.75s]:  Wait, Adam, can you repeat what you were saying? Because I cut out on the cliffhanger. Yeah, I can hear you.
Speaker 2 [1382.88s - 1383.76s]:  Yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 1 [1389.26s - 1403.80s]:  Palestinian national consciousness emerged in the 20s, maybe late 1910s, mostly in the 20s in reaction to Jewish immigration. That I believe is true. But I think that Israelis make a big deal out of it and I think it doesn't matter. So what if they emerged in the 20s?
Speaker 1 [1403.92s - 1425.11s]:  I don't think they still have deep claim to the land. They're still invested in the land. And I believe that every national identity is likely to emerge in conflict and in opposition with somebody else. It's so much easier to build your identity against something than for something. Look at, I think, most conservatives in America today. What are they? They just hate the libtards. That's all their identity is.
Speaker 1 [1425.38s - 1448.03s]:  It's easier to say what you're against than what you're for. And I believe that it's very likely that the Jews have their national and religious and ethnic identity, probably in reaction to what? Babylonian captivity, maybe? The Egyptians? We gave the example of the American colonists, too. The day it ended up, maybe before it was Pennsylvanian and it was New Hampshireian or whatever, and then they ended up
Speaker 1 [1448.03s - 1472.23s]:  finding common ground because they have a shared enemy. So while I think it's very likely the case, and Palestinians like to delude themselves, that there is the Palestinian national event, I think it's very recent, their national event. But so what? That's my thing. And then Yusuf was reacting to that and he was talking about the American colonists. Yusuf, sorry, go ahead.
Speaker 2 [1472.98s - 1502.64s]:  Yeah. I don't blame them for wanting, I don't blame the Palestinians for wanting the land for themselves if they wanted to split off from what they saw as European control. But it's also maybe not as strong of a point than if they had a national identity before
Speaker 2 [1503.25s - 1517.31s]:  And it was like the people felt that like they had established their nation, they established their people. And then the British came along and just like took over that.
Speaker 1 [1517.69s - 1542.98s]:  Yeah, so by the way, yeah, I think another point that I had brought up that I think is relevant to this is the only reason that I think we're playing that like, are they a people? Are they not a people game is because of I think Woodrow Wilson's 14 points. If you come in and you bring a framework that says, if you're a people, you get a country, well, then everybody's going to try to make a claim to peoplehood. And all the other people that don't want you to have a country was actually you're not a people.
Speaker 1 [1542.98s - 1563.37s]:  But if you reject that framework in the first place, then we should be divvying up the globe on the basis of people's peoplehood into countries. And if you reject that altogether, then those claims don't matter. And I, for example, I reject that principle that people deserve a country. I don't accept that. But
Speaker 1 [1565.35s - 1595.21s]:  Yeah. But Yusuf, I mean, to your point, I think the Palestinians, up until the 20s, early 20s, they didn't want their own country. They said, we want to be part of, we're southern Syria. We're just going to belong to the Syrians. We've always been southern Syria. That's how they saw themselves until there was upheaval in Syria. There was like a coup d'etat and whatever. And then they're like, OK, they're not coming to our help. The French are destroying them. We're going to be, we need our own country here.
Speaker 1 [1596.34s - 1620.09s]:  But when, yes, Arafat is waving the Palestinian flag, this is not the Palestinian flag that they all wrapped, this is aspirational. We spoke with Abdullah the other day, the other, because I told him about this guy that I listened to who said, someone from Ramallah won't even marry someone from Janine, right? Like someone from Jordan, Palestinian from Jordan, won't marry a Palestinian from the West Bank.
Speaker 1 [1620.38s - 1638.23s]:  And he's like, no, that's right. We don't believe, we call themselves Palestinian, but really it's about the client. It's about the specific tribe that we're in. And I feel like that might still be their mentality. But does that make a difference to anybody?
Speaker 3 [1642.07s - 1670.85s]:  Something I've been thinking about a lot is what defines indigeneity and one's claim to a land. I think they have a right to live on the land. Yeah.
Speaker 1 [1654.96s - 1676.22s]:  Let me ask you, then, do you think the Jews have claimed to the land because of their indigeneity? Assuming you think they're indigenous? Because of their indigeneity? You said, do you think Palestinians have a right to live on the land because of their indigeneity?
Speaker 2 [1681.49s - 1702.53s]:  I think so, yeah, because in my view, Arabs and Middle Easterns are just like that part of the land. So they can make the argument, but at the same time, some part of the Jews that are like the Arab Jews and the Middle Eastern Jews, they also have that same argument that they can make.
Speaker 1 [1703.71s - 1720.52s]:  Wait, you don't think, you don't think European, sorry. No, no, please, please, please, please. Okay, so you think that European Jews can't make an indigenous claim to the land?
Speaker 3 [1704.04s - 1713.32s]:  I also think, no, go ahead. You go first. Well, I don't, but you're responding to what he said specifically and I'm responding to something more general.
Speaker 2 [1725.76s - 1754.07s]:  I don't think so. Cause I feel like I'm always be like bringing it back to like the name of American argument. Like you weren't living in that land before you started making the argument that it should be your land. Like you started, like you moved to other places, whether willingly or not and started like living in other places, but now you want to come back after like another group kind of use the argument.
Speaker 1 [1734.14s - 1734.60s]:  Very good.
Speaker 3 [1751.83s - 1775.11s]:  But then that brings back my question about my friend who moved against her will to Bahrain. Does she not have a right to go back because she resettled in Bahrain? She's Palestinian. And that's what you're saying, but for Jewish people.
Speaker 2 [1772.07s - 1801.56s]:  Yeah. I feel like I would say no, but then it would like the next question would be like, why do Jews also not have that? Which is which kind of raises my next question, which is like,
Speaker 3 [1778.39s - 1781.83s]:  So like, does she not have a right of return then? Is that what you're saying too?
Speaker 2 [1802.19s - 1811.05s]:  Why is there kind of not like in the modern day, why is there like that distinction between European Jews and Arab Jews?
Speaker 1 [1814.67s - 1817.28s]:  I don't, I'm not following.
Speaker 3 [1816.85s - 1840.76s]:  Well, okay. In my opinion, the reason why there's a distinction because like the middle Eastern Jews are also Jews that came from Israel. Originally they were exiled for at whatever period in time. And then they eventually found their new homes in the middle East. And those are just countries that aren't in Israel. Right. And then it's like the same thing for Jews. They, they, they were scattered all over the world. So they also went to Europe.
Speaker 3 [1840.76s - 1867.74s]:  and they settled in those countries and so these are all different countries in different parts of the world and I don't really think it makes any sense to distinguish between European Jews and Middle Eastern Jews because they the fact of the matter is they were all exiled from Israel at some point in history and have a right to return to Israel and the reason why there is a distinguishing between it is just because there's a lot of anti-west sentiment in the Middle East
Speaker 1 [1860.69s - 1868.85s]:  Thank you.
Speaker 3 [1867.74s - 1894.36s]:  And so, like, when people are advocating for Palestinian right of return, they're like, okay, yeah, I guess it also makes sense to have, like, the Middle Eastern Jews have a right of return because, like, we were for the Middle East in general. If they're not anti-Semitic, if they are, then they're like, well, the Palestinians get all of it, and Palestine should be Arab from the river to the sea, right?
Speaker 3 [1895.49s - 1920.71s]:  Um, but yeah, I think that might be that I can, that's the only thing I can think of there being a reason to have a distinguishing between, um, the Middle Eastern Jews and the European Jews right to return to Israel. Dash Palestine. Let me know if I can clarify anything.
Speaker 1 [1914.28s - 1934.28s]:  views if you buy it. The distinction itself is preparing. I think that's the claim, right? Beyond, I think you're making the claim that the distinction itself might even have some historical, some bias associated. It's your take on that.
Speaker 2 [1919.94s - 1948.92s]:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I feel like that might also be part of the reason for the criticism now is that
Speaker 2 [1951.41s - 1979.24s]:  the fact that that distinction was created were coming from Europe in the first place like they couldn't really and for the Palestinians that were living during this time that the Jews were like moving in they can't I feel like it's hard for them to take people that were living in Europe that were like considered by
Speaker 2 [1979.68s - 2003.34s]:  descendants of that time, like European rather than Arab or Middle Eastern. And now they're coming here. I feel like, I feel like creating that distinction is like something that created like this service to the Jews that were coming back because now they had to live with that like title that they were Europeans and kind of taking, taking away where they came from.
Speaker 3 [1999.79s - 2028.17s]:  Yeah. What's crazy is that my, my Palestinian friend, she stopped being friends. Can you hear me better now? I turned my camera off. Okay.
Speaker 1 [2010.88s - 2015.76s]:  Well, Bianna, I don't think we hear you very well. Maybe that's just me, though. And I'm going to be right.
Speaker 2 [2015.25s - 2026.89s]:  No, yeah, no, same. Yeah, yeah, we can hear you. Yeah, I think you're fine. Yeah, you're good now.
Speaker 3 [2029.15s - 2055.49s]:  Yeah, I was just saying that so my Palestinian friend isn't friends with me anymore. And it's really sad because I wanted to work through it, but she like set a boundary with me pretty quickly so we didn't really have the opportunity.
Speaker 3 [2067.01s - 2085.01s]:  And so it's like, the Europeans were nice.
Speaker 2 [2090.50s - 2106.82s]:  You were cutting out before. Yeah.
Speaker 1 [2092.91s - 2114.38s]:  I think now she's fully gone. Let me ask you because I think that I have a very different take on these things than both of you guys. But just to proceed with the same analogy that you were going for, let's imagine that the
Speaker 1 [2115.33s - 2126.87s]:  The Portuguese, the British came to North America and they took the Cherokees and sent them into exile in slavery in Europe.
Speaker 1 [2127.59s - 2155.03s]:  And after a hundred years, they're like, you know, we want to go back to our ancient homeland. Like we are from, I don't know where the Cherokees were. We're from whatever place, and we're Massachusetts, and we want to go back to Massachusetts. That's where our God is. That's where our national, our ethnic, our religious, our tribal identity was formed. We want to go back there. And you would say, sorry, busted, you're already coming from Europe. That doesn't work for you anymore. Is that what you would have said?
Speaker 2 [2159.63s - 2182.50s]:  Yeah, I feel like living at that point back then when they were like trying to come back and there was that name and there was no way to really prove that they were. I feel like that would be like the natural response because it's like
Speaker 2 [2183.44s - 2212.38s]:  you were gone and you were like, you were like, given this label, you were living in this other place and now you're coming back saying that you're native to this land. It's like, I don't know. I'm saying like, in the case that you were saying, like if like a chair. And yeah, like,
Speaker 1 [2190.37s - 2206.08s]:  Oh, wait, wait. Are you questioning whether Jews originate from Judea? Let's imagine they prefer the same traditions. I mean, it's absolutely clear. You do genetic testing. It's all absolutely clear.
Speaker 2 [2214.09s - 2237.65s]:  If they do that and it's because it'll say like, yes, they originated from the Middle East that they are Middle Eastern, then yeah, they should have the right to go back to the Middle East where they came from.
Speaker 1 [2230.59s - 2247.21s]:  OK, so you believe that the Jews, because of their indigeneity, assuming you accept their indigeneity claim, assuming that you accept Jews come from there, you think they have a right to go back to Israel. You see, I disagree with that, actually.
Speaker 2 [2243.99s - 2263.25s]:  Yeah.
Speaker 1 [2248.80s - 2272.21s]:  I don't think they have a right to go back because they're from there. I don't think the Native Americans have a right to go back because they're from there. I don't think the Palestinians have a right to go back because that's where they're from. I don't believe in that type of thing. I believe that if your ancestors are, just because I can't imagine building a stable international system on the basis of that kind of claim,
Speaker 1 [2272.69s - 2300.90s]:  Who knows where people are from? I mean, everyone's from everywhere. The one constant in human history is human migration. This is happening every single place and every single century with every single people. The moment that you're gonna be able to play by those rules, there's no end to the kind of international strife you will continue to sow. I can't imagine building international system on the basis of these principles.
Speaker 1 [2301.14s - 2322.89s]:  That being said, what I'm saying is I understand the Jews, okay, here's, oh, Viata is joining. Should I repeat that last thing? Because I think it's, yeah. Viata, can you hear us? So the example that I posed, can I, you can hear us, right?
Speaker 2 [2301.73s - 2312.04s]:  Yeah. Mm hmm.
Speaker 3 [2313.44s - 2336.85s]:  Sorry, guys. Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1 [2324.91s - 2352.36s]:  I want to give you the example that I gave to Yousef, and I think that both of us then settled on clarity, and now I'm pushing back on both of you guys. Was that cool? Okay, so the example was, what happens if, let's say like the British came to North America, captured the Cherokees, and then exiled them into slavery in Europe, and they lived there for 100 years in bondage or whatever,
Speaker 1 [2352.36s - 2380.62s]:  And but they've maintained the same traditions, the same rituals, the same everything. And now after 100 years, they're saying we want to go back to our ancient homeland. That's in Massachusetts. That's where our God is. That's where our traditions are. That's where we formed our national, ethnic, religious, spiritual identity. The question is whether they would have a right to go back by the claim of indigeneity. And I think the Yusuf agreed that they would have that right, even though they're coming from Europe. You're with us, right, Viara, still can hear us?
Speaker 3 [2373.83s - 2381.90s]:  Yeah, yeah, I'm still with you.
Speaker 1 [2382.26s - 2406.14s]:  So then with the same analogy, he also would attribute the same rights to the Jews, even though they're coming from Europe, if they can sort of prove that that's where they originated from. And I think for the sake of argument, we're just assuming that they can prove that. Whatever genetic testing, the rituals, the traditions, the language, all of that, let's imagine they've
Speaker 3 [2405.09s - 2429.80s]:  Well, you can. Okay.
Speaker 1 [2406.32s - 2425.37s]:  That's right. That's right. So I think you can. I believe Yusuf probably believes that we can too, but let's just imagine for now as an assumption, assuming that he's persuaded that you can, then fine. I still push back on both of these. I actually don't think they have a right to go back. Neither the Cherokees nor the Palestinians.
Speaker 1 [2429.55s - 2437.91s]:  Because I think that I'm just trying to reason about how you might want to build a stable international system.
Speaker 1 [2438.18s - 2467.26s]:  that continues to allow different people to constantly move and demand sovereignty in these different areas and not respect the other people that live there and their sense of immigration policies. I can't imagine what such a system would look like. It sounds incredibly chaotic. The one thing I, this was interesting, last year I went on a trip, I visited lots of countries and every country I went to, I went to the National Museum.
Speaker 1 [2467.59s - 2496.90s]:  And you see how they all start the same way. Our people came from here, and then just in big maps of where the migration waves came from. The one constant in all of human history is human migration. That's what I'm seeing. And I just can't imagine building a stable international order on the basis. So that doesn't mean that I am not sympathetic to people's claims. If you want to live in Hebron, because your ancestors came from Hebron, buy a house there.
Speaker 1 [2496.99s - 2525.09s]:  there should be reasonable immigration policies that allow people to realize their aspirations. I don't know. I don't feel anything for Hebron. I don't feel anything for Jerusalem. But I feel very strongly for Athens. That's what I feel like. That's where I have my religious, my spiritual moments is in the Agora and Athens. Whatever, right? Some people have a different place. So I think that wouldn't it make sense to just say that
Speaker 3 [2519.79s - 2547.55s]:  I mean, I don't think that it's very wise to go based off feeling though.
Speaker 1 [2525.49s - 2534.75s]:  It isn't a right that a nation has, but an individual should be allowed to pursue their own sense of identity however they wish.
Speaker 1 [2549.26s - 2558.81s]:  But why else would anyone care about their, like, why do Jews care about going back to Jerusalem if it's not for feeling?
Speaker 3 [2556.90s - 2570.62s]:  Like, well, the feelings are derived from like spiritual connection that's like documented and genetic connection.
Speaker 3 [2571.70s - 2601.49s]:  So these are tangible reasons why somebody feels emotionally attached to a place. But I think determining it by an individual's feelings towards a certain place means that if a Korean who had never been to Greece but went to the Agora or the Metropolis or whatever,
Speaker 1 [2581.48s - 2584.75s]:  But wouldn't the most documented stuff is correct?
Speaker 3 [2601.87s - 2616.95s]:  What's it called? Acropolis, sorry, in Athens. And they're like, oh, this is where I was meant to be, even though they'd never been there and they had no genetic ties whatsoever. They did 21. What's it, whatever it's called?
Speaker 1 [2617.24s - 2647.18s]:  Like if you ran me or something? Yeah. Oh, no, I'm sorry. No, that's what I mean. I just mean like, if the guy wants, just buy a combo in Athens, if that's what matters to him.
Speaker 3 [2618.25s - 2647.59s]:  23andMe, no genetic ties, no historic ties, no religious ties, nothing, then I don't think it makes sense for each person to be able to determine, oh, this is like, I think you should be able to apply and go through the process and legally immigrate and become a Greek if you want to, but yeah.
Speaker 1 [2648.06s - 2672.96s]:  That's all I need. No nationality. Yeah. I think that I'm not a big fan of nationality, but I think that people should have, like the right is not about a people, but it should be perhaps at the individual level. It's not like our people have a right.
Speaker 3 [2648.64s - 2678.25s]:  Yeah, I agree. But in terms of initial nationality, you don't think that anybody should have a nationality. I don't know. I feel like I get it. I get that argument. And I understand it. And I resonate with it. But at the same time,
Speaker 3 [2679.62s - 2703.22s]:  I don't think I agree with it because I think it's just, I think it's, I think there's like each human being has various senses of community and like belonging within a certain group. And I don't think you can, it's, I think it's kind of dangerous to ignore that aspect.
Speaker 1 [2703.13s - 2703.81s]:  No.
Speaker 3 [2703.22s - 2724.21s]:  I think that there's a lot of dangers with like even having an nationality like you're saying because then it's an us versus them mentality. It's conducive to that kind of mentality but on the other hand, I think there's a greater danger to having each person think and figure out their own individual identity because you kind of see that with
Speaker 3 [2724.21s - 2738.47s]:  like people who have mixed identities for example mixed ethnicities already you can see like people are having very serious difficulties because they don't feel like they belong in either one of them fully.
Speaker 1 [2738.90s - 2765.64s]:  Yeah, but my claim isn't that people shouldn't have communal identity. My claim is that those communities don't have rights. It's not a right of a community. It's not like the rest of the world needs to now bend over backwards or whatever to accommodate rights of a community. They can accommodate rights that individuals have.
Speaker 1 [2765.95s - 2785.55s]:  And if those individuals choose to exercise their rights in a way that flourishes community identity, that's fine. That's up to them. They could do whatever they want. I'm not against community identity or like a membership in a community. There are plenty of benefits to that and risks.
Speaker 1 [2786.97s - 2815.26s]:  I don't think that you can, because I mean, fine, like most of the best documented, the best genetic thing is that all of us are from Africa. So now that's all of us go back to Africa. I just can't, I can't see how we can play that kind of game at scale. Like that game doesn't sound like it scales.
Speaker 3 [2796.56s - 2820.21s]:  Yeah, we're all Africans. Yeah, and that kind of falls nicely into my question that I asked her there about what determines indigeneity and a right to the land.
Speaker 1 [2822.64s - 2840.84s]:  Right. And my feeling is that Yusef and you probably both agree more on those things than I do. I think that's my suspicion is that I don't think there's any, I don't believe in that concept.
Speaker 3 [2841.87s - 2864.50s]:  But even buying land, it gives certain people priority over others to the land, right? Because if you don't have the money to be able to purchase something, then you're not able to go there. Yeah.
Speaker 1 [2859.29s - 2887.06s]:  Yeah, yeah. But that's a claim for property rights. But I think the claim is about, let's see. Let me ask you, Beata, then this question. Do you think that it should have been the legitimate
Speaker 3 [2869.65s - 2879.02s]:  like actually living there because at the same time there's so many different ways of living that you could definitely figure if you really wanted to be somewhere you could figure out a way to be there.
Speaker 1 [2887.67s - 2897.35s]:  right of the Palestinians in the 20s to decide their own immigration policy and reject the Jewish waves of immigration.
Speaker 3 [2899.74s - 2924.87s]:  Um, I, I think, yeah, I think people who have, I don't think that they, okay. I think that the people who live on the land have the right to govern what happens to the land.
Speaker 1 [2925.90s - 2940.33s]:  That's right.
Speaker 3 [2926.00s - 2952.45s]:  just as like people in the United States have a right to determine who they're going to elect based off of what their stance is on immigration policy. But then the question is, do I think that they should have rejected the waves of Jewish immigration? No. But do they have the right to determine who comes and who goes based on the current framework of how all countries work and are run? Yes.
Speaker 1 [2953.70s - 2973.06s]:  use of my question then for you is, despite her commitment to indigeneity, or what sounds like a commitment to indigeneity, is it surprising to you how reasonable she sounds on the question of whether Palestinians should have had the rights to reject Jews?
Speaker 2 [2980.71s - 3007.69s]:  I feel like not really because it goes back to what I was saying before, like if they were living somewhere else and wanted to come back just based on how indigenous they were and seeking refuge with the people that were living there who were the Palestinians. The Palestinians have the right to decide for themselves if they want to let the Jews in or not. Yeah, I agree with that.
Speaker 3 [3003.92s - 3031.27s]:  That's what I said. Yeah, I mean, they're the ones that are the...
Speaker 1 [3005.01s - 3023.61s]:  Yeah, that's right. Well, OK, that's great. So let me ask you another question. On the same token, do you then both agree that the Jews should have the rights to determine whether or not Palestinians get to come back to Jaffa and Ramle and Haifa?
Speaker 3 [3033.35s - 3062.57s]:  What's it called? I can't think of the word. The people create the laws right now. So yeah, they're the ones who have the responsibility to, in my opinion, they're the ones who have the responsibility to ensure a right of return for the Palestinians who wish it. Yeah, whatever they choose. Yeah, but I feel like they have an ethical responsibility.
Speaker 1 [3039.31s - 3060.84s]:  Yeah. And it's legitimate whatever they choose. I mean, you may or may not agree with it, but at least you accept that it's legitimate. Yes, if you agree.
Speaker 2 [3062.02s - 3084.14s]:  I feel like that's where I disagree because if you became the government that you are now through some other means that didn't give the people the right to decide if they wanted you to begin with, I feel like it also shouldn't apply because if
Speaker 2 [3085.09s - 3110.09s]:  If the Palestinian, like there are two scenarios that I see that could go either way. If the Palestinian had the right to decide for themselves if they wanted the Jews in or not, and they let them in, and we got this situation that we have now, which I still think wouldn't be the case if they were let in peacefully, but like, just for the sake of the analogy, like if
Speaker 2 [3111.56s - 3141.30s]:  they were allowed in peacefully and the Jews were able to set up the government and take over that government, then yeah, they have just the same right of determining who gets into their land and who doesn't. But if the Jews, if the Palestinians were given that choice to let them in and they would have said, no, I don't think the Jews should be given more of a choice than the Palestinians did before.
Speaker 1 [3143.46s - 3169.58s]:  So you're saying that let's imagine, let's say Japan right now is a country with a government that was an illegitimate government in its origin. It was non-democratic, it was non-liberal, it was monarchical, and probably theocratic in a sense.
Speaker 2 [3160.98s - 3184.82s]:  What do you mean that they started as like a different form of government than what
Speaker 1 [3170.33s - 3197.35s]:  Should they now not have the rights to choose their own border policy because they had this kind of origin? Yeah, they started an illegitimate form of, yeah, they started illegitimately. That's the claim you're making about the Jews. However they started, right now it's a liberal democracy and all of the people get to choose.
Speaker 2 [3191.60s - 3218.78s]:  I look.
Speaker 1 [3197.62s - 3221.87s]:  And whether or not it had an ignominious beginning, that's the situation now. Would you say the same thing about Pakistan and India? They both had a start with, no, the people didn't really get to choose, and they fled, and exiles, and way worse things that happened in the Natwa. Well, then, are you saying that now Indians and Pakistanis don't have a right to choose their border policy?
Speaker 2 [3221.49s - 3241.27s]:  And in both of those situations were the Pakistani and Indian or like the Japanese were was their government was like the governmental decisions that were made for those under a party that was different from the people that were living there. Was the decision was.
Speaker 3 [3240.16s - 3252.33s]:  Yeah, because the British colonized, the British colonized, and then they created India and Pakistan before leaving, just like literally identical to Israel and Palestine.
Speaker 2 [3255.25s - 3272.69s]:  Yeah, I think in both of those situations, like the countries themselves before, like without, without the colonialism should have had the right to decide. And now that
Speaker 2 [3275.52s - 3297.69s]:  But I think to make this to make me like understand it a little bit better is the situation in like how similar is the situation in how this sounds similar to like how is that similar to is your path emphasize like how it started? Yeah.
Speaker 3 [3289.92s - 3311.80s]:  India was a British colony. Remember the British India grade company? Yeah, so India was a British colony, and Muslims and Hindus lived together side by side in all of India, and they also had other minorities living in India.
Speaker 3 [3312.48s - 3332.33s]:  Gandhi led the anti-colonial movement, right? Like the peaceful movement marched across, did the salt march and everything. And so eventually the British were like, okay, we need to get out of here because they're really pushing for independence from us.
Speaker 3 [3332.82s - 3356.20s]:  And there was another politician who was advocating for a Muslim country and a Hindu country. So in the past, if you look at the ethnic distribution within colonial India, it's so intertwined with Hindus and Muslims.
Speaker 3 [3356.66s - 3372.30s]:  And then because they advocated for a Muslim in a Hindu country before Britain left, they broke it into the country of India and the country of Pakistan. And as a result, there were seven to eight million
Speaker 3 [3373.70s - 3398.35s]:  Muslims and 78 million Hindus ethnically cleansed by the other group because they were used to all live side by side with one another. And then as a result of this separation and the need to have a Muslim in Hindu state, there was mass ethnic cleansing due to the British creating essentially the same thing as what happened with Israel and Palestine.
Speaker 2 [3399.29s - 3417.01s]:  Mm hmm. Yeah. So I remember the original question like, if because those governments started originally, do they also not have a say on like, who gets like, to get back into the land that they claim was theirs before? Right?
Speaker 1 [3417.94s - 3446.60s]:  Yeah. Well, yeah, but like, do you see how
Speaker 2 [3419.55s - 3442.50s]:  Okay. Then, yeah, the same, I feel like the same logic applies if you got back country illegitimately. It's like, I don't see why you should have a say if the people you originally took it from who didn't really want to say why you should control if they get to come back or not.
Speaker 1 [3446.78s - 3473.44s]:  You could say the same thing about Germany, about Poland, about Czechoslovakia, about Russia, about Ukraine, about, like there's no country that, I mean, Italy, Austria, I mean, I can't picture a single country that didn't end up emerging its sovereignty on the basis of war that involved refugees. I can't, like I can't, and so you're just, it sounds like you're advocating for like a global reset.
Speaker 1 [3474.07s - 3503.15s]:  And I can't imagine where you would choose the starting point. So either you're calling for a global reset or you're calling for only a reset in the case of the Jews. And obviously they would feel like you're targeting them and you're applying a double standard here. One standard for everyone else, second standard for the Jews or something else. But like it's something doesn't sound
Speaker 1 [3504.10s - 3505.03s]:  very workable.
Speaker 2 [3508.83s - 3536.29s]:  I think if I had to summarize what I think about it is because a lot of how I feel about it now is because of what's happening. And I feel like even though it started with violence from the Arabs, I feel like the situation now to me at least feels less
Speaker 2 [3537.12s - 3566.68s]:  like it should be about who gets the land and more about like trying to find a solution that ends the war that's going on now and like kind of starting not necessarily a new page but like trying to move on from what's happening now like the issues of like like who should get back to the land who should like
Speaker 1 [3552.52s - 3553.01s]:  Um,
Speaker 2 [3567.04s - 3587.21s]:  whose land it should be, I feel like that's a little less of a concern to me and more of like, what's happening now shouldn't be happening. And like, that's the thing that needs to be solved less than we should get the land first or who has more of a right to land than the other.
Speaker 1 [3589.87s - 3618.66s]:  Yeah, what do you think about that? I couldn't hear you. Something with that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think I agree too. The only person that I think wouldn't agree is Abdullah. And which is so interesting because he and his family are the people suffering the most.
Speaker 3 [3593.01s - 3611.20s]:  I feel like that's, I agree that. Oh, I just said I agree.
Speaker 2 [3610.16s - 3610.61s]:  Yeah.
Speaker 1 [3619.43s - 3642.57s]:  yet they don't want to have that conversation of like the pragmatics of the next steps, or at least they want to do it very reluctantly because his family's standing in. Yeah, he's from the, his family's from the West Bank, but now he lives in Jordan. And yeah, so that's,
Speaker 3 [3625.78s - 3638.52s]:  Wait, what ethnicity is he? Oh, he's Palestinian? I didn't know. Yeah, I know that.
Speaker 1 [3644.10s - 3661.94s]:  And I feel like that's the use of like, you're right. I mean, oftentimes I like to push for, all right, let's just think about the future. Let's stop worrying about the past. It's difficult to just worry about the future if the narrative people have in mind is that the Jewish state is a Nazi state.
Speaker 1 [3662.16s - 3691.05s]:  You know what I mean? Like, if you were to tell me, okay, now I'll just figure out stuff with the Nazis, I'll be like, wait, what? I can't even begin to process this. They are Nazis. I think it'd be very difficult for me. And I have a feeling that that's kind of how a lot of Arabs just see Israel. They see Israel the way I see the Nazis. And so there is no compromise. I'm not gonna sit in the room with Nazis right now. It's not gonna happen. So in some way we have to kind of,
Speaker 1 [3691.63s - 3719.17s]:  remove that, we have to dismantle that parsing, that impression. And I also think that on that note, Israel has a lot of responsibility here to try to remove that impression. And they could do more to remove that impression, to clean that up. But the rest of the world has even more responsibility. Honestly, people in America have the most responsibility, I think, and Europeans, not to add
Speaker 1 [3720.21s - 3727.77s]:  fuel to the flame and really to try to because I feel like they have they tend to have a little bit less
Speaker 3 [3723.22s - 3723.76s]:  Why?
Speaker 1 [3728.61s - 3752.76s]:  I can't honestly, right now in Israelis and shelters, I'm not going to ask them to really try to have a very nuanced and compassionate perspective for the other narratives. They don't have space for that. They're not going to do it. They're so wounded at this point, and injured, and they are feeling like their lives is at risk. So there's no room for that. Certainly not on the Palestinian side.
Speaker 1 [3752.76s - 3776.80s]:  Palestinians can't now be magnanimous and be able to really try to understand how the world looks like from the Jewish and from the Israeli. They can't. They're now in survival mode. I can't expect that. But what I hope is for the rest of the world to be able to see the narratives and proportion and not to stoke up the flames in the region. And I feel like they're doing the exact opposite.
Speaker 1 [3781.41s - 3808.78s]:  Why? Because again, I think it's easier for them to carve out their own identity, their own social status. Perhaps it's for the white Americans to launder their guilt on the Middle East or to clean up or to seem like they're in support of black and brown people in America. It's all about that. And it has nothing to do with actual concern for the people in the region. It has much more to do with concern for them and their own social standing. And I feel like that is the end of something.
Speaker 3 [3807.31s - 3834.96s]:  Yeah. Yeah, definitely. That resonates with me. And also, I mean, I think a lot of these people don't fully realize that. I think like, I think maybe the Jewish Americans maybe realize it.
Speaker 1 [3814.46s - 3830.71s]:  You know what I mean? Do you see that too? Does that resonate or am I off them? Like what do you? Yeah. Hmm.
Speaker 2 [3816.70s - 3825.09s]:  Yeah, me too.
Speaker 3 [3836.30s - 3849.87s]:  that they're doing it because like they feel specifically socially attacked if they're not like out at the protests because that's what happened to me personally and that's what I like I read a book on
Speaker 3 [3851.61s - 3881.12s]:  Um, by Barry Wallace, who, who was, who wrote a book called how to fight antisemitism. And she was talking about her personal experiences where like there's anti quote unquote anti Zionist Jews. And then, and then it's just the two of them late at night and they go out and they, they say that they pour their souls out to her. Um, but yeah, it's small, it's short. You can read it in like a day.
Speaker 1 [3874.58s - 3899.91s]:  It's a good book. I saw a party one time, and my mom didn't know who she was. My mom walked up to her.
Speaker 3 [3882.19s - 3911.54s]:  um i wouldn't say it's like too too helpful but it was good for me when i was going through my realizations about the state of things at the after october 7th um that's so cool
Speaker 1 [3900.25s - 3912.64s]:  And they started talking about this and that. And then they started texting one another to go to yoga class together. Like, Mom, what the fuck is Barry Weiss? Are you serious?
Speaker 3 [3912.21s - 3936.39s]:  But the other people who are quote on, like allies to the Palestinian cause, I feel like they're projecting the maltreatment of their histories and their experiences even in the modern day onto the conflict that's happening now. And so they're not, they feel like they have to do this out of allyship to the cause.
Speaker 3 [3937.12s - 3960.33s]:  But the reality is that they're not actually doing it for the cause. They're doing it because it makes them feel good to fight against something that. Hypothetical like this concept and they just like to project their previous plates onto the onto the conflict instead of opening their eyes and seeing what's actually going on.
Speaker 1 [3962.16s - 3974.97s]:  It used to be somebody who's a little bit more on that side. Do you see that at all? Or is that just what Jews tell themselves? No, no, I want to know.
Speaker 3 [3969.75s - 3973.05s]:  Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to like, at you.
Speaker 2 [3974.62s - 4004.31s]:  No, you're fine. Yeah. I never really like shocked me a certain way because that was like how I like envisioned like the protests going. But yeah, like it's not really my like view as well, like either. So like,
Speaker 2 [4005.54s - 4023.30s]:  Want to project that onto another group and like to try to like fight back like it's not it's like missing or like missed the point of like what the actual conflict is. Or the point of like finding a resolution.
Speaker 1 [4020.03s - 4044.74s]:  Yeah. Yesterday we created this very large mind map. Maybe we'll show it to you next time. Because we're trying to figure out, what are all of the options? What could go right? What are different things that can happen? Oh, sorry. I think the exercise that we wanted to do was
Speaker 1 [4044.74s - 4073.03s]:  for Abdullah and like more of the pro-Palestine side. And I was playing a, for these conversations I tend to play like a pro-Israeli side, but I feel like I can, I can, another conversations I can play with better, I think persuasive pro-Palestinian side. So on those conversations I was trying to do, oh yeah, so yesterday we tried to come up with like an exercise for 10 minutes. Can we reach some, what can we agree on?
Speaker 1 [4074.14s - 4096.00s]:  in terms of next steps. And we were thinking about that and then Abdullah was like, I think I can't really see anything to agree on right now, it'd be too difficult. I think I can only really see the downsides and how things can go wrong. So we're like, all right, so let's do that exercise first. So then we came up with like a very large mind map of all the different things that can go wrong.
Speaker 1 [4096.20s - 4124.58s]:  And now it's just like a massive kind of mind map. And now I think the next step we wanted to say, all right, now how do we tackle each one of them and convert them into something good as opposed to something bad? Open another exercise. I'll send that to you too. I'll send it. You might like it. Gmail or Berkeley would be better. Yeah, yes.
Speaker 3 [4097.06s - 4126.05s]:  Yeah, I sent it. Yeah, thanks. I'm impartial.
Speaker 2 [4117.26s - 4136.89s]:  Yeah, we can definitely continue that. Yeah, we can continue that next time, maybe. All right, yep. Thank you, guys. Have a good weekend.
Speaker 1 [4127.70s - 4140.40s]:  OK, so I'll send it to Jimin. All right, guys, this has been fun. Thank you very much. Yeah, thanks. Thanks. See ya.
Speaker 3 [4132.99s - 4140.37s]:  Yeah, great talk. Thank you. Yeah, of course. Thanks. Bye bye.
